ThinkPig: Rootin' for brain truffles. Wallowing in yer mind. I'd be a Hippo but I just can't swim.

Listen to this and I'll tell you 'bout the heartache
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the loss of God
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul
